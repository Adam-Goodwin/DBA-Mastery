# About me

My name is [Carlos Robles] but known as [DBA master], I'm a Microsoft Data Platform MVP and multi-platform Database Administrator (SQL Server, Azure SQL DB, Oracle and MySQL). With more than 10 years of experience in the database administration field, I have had the opportunity to work with different platforms (Linux, Windows, Unix, on-premise, virtual, cloud) for large scale US based companies from different industries like healthcare, food, energy, technology, insurance and banking.

I recently got the honor to get the Microsoft MVP Award in the data platform category, this means that I’m a technology expert who passionately share his knowledge with the community.

Also have multiple certifications under my belt (MCP, MCTS, MCSA, MCSE) from the 2008 version until 2016 including Azure SQL DB, ITIL v3 and recently getting certified in Docker Containers, Kubernetes and RedHat redshift.

I have developed a few open source tools like MAXDOP Calculator, Wait Stats widget for Azure Data Studio; please take a look at my GitHub repository and help me giving me some feedback.

Leader of [Guatemala SQL Server user group], mentor, speaker at SQL Saturday’s and SQL local groups events.  Recently debuted as author; I started to write articles for Simple-Talk (Redgate), [SQL Server Central] and [MSSQL Tips].

If you don’t find me talking about SQL Server or geek stuff on twitter, it is very likely that I will be online playing videos games with my wife and daughter or hiking around the Denver mountains.

Feel free to [email] or tweet me with any questions, comments. I’m always happy to help and learn from the #SQLFamily.

I hope you find all the information/ DBA tips shared in this repository are useful for you.

Sincerely,
DBA Master
